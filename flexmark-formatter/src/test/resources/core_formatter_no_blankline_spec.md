## Format Conversion

```````````````````````````````` example Format Conversion: 1
Adds missing editor actions for end of word navigation but that is just the beginning:

* Enable Auto Indent Lines after move line/selection up or down actions to have them indented
  automatically.
* Use Smart Paste to eliminate case change and prefix edits when pasting identifiers. MIA will
  match case and style of identifier at destination when you paste, undo to get results before
  MIA adjusted them. Copy `myColumnData` and paste it over `DEFAULT_VALUE` to get `COLUMN_DATA`,
  reverse the order and get `myDefaultValue`. Works when pasting at the **beginning**, **end**
  and **middle** of identifiers.

  Supports: **camelCase**, **PascalCase**, **snake_case**, **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE**,
  **dash-case**, **dot.case**, **slash/case**

  Default prefixes: `my`, `our`, `is`, `get`, `set` to allow pasting over member fields, static
  fields, getters and setters.
* Enable Auto Line Selections and select full lines without loosing time or column position by
  moving the caret to the start of line when selecting or pasting. **Choose** whether you want
  to **paste full line** selections: **above** or **below** the current line regardless of the
  caret's column.
* Toggle between selection and multiple carets on selected lines to save time re-selecting the
  same text again.
* Filter multiple carets saves you time when creating multiple carets by removing carets on
  blank or comment lines so you can edit only code lines.
* Enhanced Paste from History dialog:
  * **combine**, **arrange** and **reverse** the order of content entries
  * **combine multiple** clipboard contents **with caret information intact**
  * **paste and re-create multiple carets** from information already stored on the clipboard
  * **duplicate line/block for each caret** in the clipboard content and **put a caret on the
    first line** of the block, ready for multi-caret select and paste
  * see caret information stored on the clipboard for each content entry
* Many more options and adjustments to make multiple caret text editing fast, efficient and
  easy. **Plugin website:

Work with [Markdown] files like you do with other languages in the IDE, by getting full support
for:

* completions to reduce typing
* link address ⇐ files
* ref anchors ⇐ headings
* footnote refs ⇐ footnotes
* ref links/ref images ⇐ references
* link text ⇐ ref anchor/link address
* error and warning annotations to help catch mistakes early
* intention actions for fast results with less effort
* wrap on typing to keep it nicely formatted as you edit
* formatting to change format with a key stroke
* navigation and find usages to find references without effort
* refactoring of all referencing elements: to keep it all in sync while evolving
* files ⟺ links
* headings ⟺ ref anchors
* footnotes ⟺ footnote refs
* references ⟺ ref links/ref images
* GitHub style rendering that you are used to, out of the box
* Fast typing response for distraction free editing
* Fully customizable to adjust to your project's needs and your preferences
